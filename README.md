#EN2AM

I started this project because I didn't find the current amharic typing natural.
People on facebook and other chat applications type english that has an amharic
meaning when read by the other party. If we can adopt this priniciple and
have the converter implemented, it would encourage people to write more in Amharic
by using an english keyboard and without the caveat of loosing speed while typing using
the current amharic typing programs.

#Requirement

C++11 compiler and CMake

#Runnig

Currently the tool can only be used from the command line

example

>en2am  "yh ya^etyophyaa hzb dmts naw"

>ይህ የኤትዮጵያ ህዝብ ድምፅ ነው 

**Note:** You may use programs like xclip for transferrign CLI text to teh OS's clipboard.

All mappings are found in core/en2am.h
