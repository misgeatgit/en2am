I found typing amharic with the current system very boring and discouraging. I
am continiously pausing to check if the combination of english characters I
typed are properly converted to the equivalent **single** amharic character.
I don't really get why all the system don't do the conversion in batch mode?

So I started writing my own batch mode converter. The trick here is introducing
a different sequency for the vowels which will avoid confusion during token
matching. I'll describe this may be later. Enough for now.
