#EN2AM

I started this project because I didn't find the current amharic typing natural.
People on facebook and other chat applications type english that has an amharic
meaning when read by the other party. If we can adopt this priniciple and
have the converter implementation, it would encourage people to write more in Amharic
by making it less daunting for them.

#Requirement

C++11 compiler and CMake

#Runnig

Currently the tool can only be used from the command line

example

>en2am  "yh ya^etyophyaa hzb dmts naw"

>ይህ የኤትዮጵያ ህዝብ ድምፅ ነው 

All mappings are found in core/en2am.h
